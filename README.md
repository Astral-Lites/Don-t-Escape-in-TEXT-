What is Don't Escape?
"Don't Escape" is a flash game where you play as a werewolf trapped inside a lodge. As night falls, you must gather resources, secure the area, and make sure you Don’t Escape because if you do, you'll be out for blood. but this time it's a Text Based Adventure made for Python!  

**Features**  
- **Actions**: Lock doors, board windows, secure yourself, and brew a potion to help contain the werewolf inside.  
- **PICK IT UP!**: Pick up items from around the lodge to help you in your mission to stay in control.  
- **Decisions, Decisions**: Your decisions matter—secure the right items in time to survive, or risk the lives of everyone around you.  
- **More than one!**: Based on how well you secure the lodge, you’ll get different endings ranging from saving everyone to the opposite of saving(you know killing?).  
- **Simple but Honest**: All actions are driven by text input(yes no sh* because it's Text Based now).

**Controls**  
- **GO THERE!**: Choose which area of the lodge to visit (and hopefully find what you need).
- **PICK IT UP! PART TWO**: Collect items from the areas to add to your inventory.
- **BLOCK THAT SH&%**: Choose what to secure based on the items you've gathered.
- **Prepare for NIGHT**: Once you're ready, confirm if you're prepared for the night and see the results of your actions.

Each action is selected by typing a number from the available choices. It’s simple and direct, making it easy to dive into the survival experience.

**Known Bugs?/Limitations?**  
- **Text-Based Transition**: As I said this used to be a Point and Click Flash Game that i turned into Text Based so most of the cooler mechanics and cool artstyle orignally from the game is all gone but still a
  unique experience I must say.
- **Inventory and Action Limitation**: You might feel limited by the text based system for inventory management and actions. There's no drag-and-drop or visual feedback like in the original game.

**Final Thoughts**
-Hope you enjoy the game whoever comes across this (most def my prof) but yeah Happy Trails!!
